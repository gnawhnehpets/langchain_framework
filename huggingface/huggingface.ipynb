However, the evolution of these changes have not been well delineated. \\nWe demonstrate that exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to chronic cigarette \\nsmoke causes progressive gene promoter DNA hypermethylation that associates with \\nactivation of key signaling pathways driving the tumorigenic process. The methylated \\ngene abnormalities highly overlap with those commonly seen in non-small cell lung \\ncancer. Most importantly, these epigenetic changes may predispose cells to single step \\ntransformation mediated by a single oncogene, mutated KRAS , in the absence of other \\ndriver genetic changes.
